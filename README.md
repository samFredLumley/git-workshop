All the good stuff used in the GIC git workshop.

All the slide content is in [slide.md](https://github.com/samFredLumley/git-workshop/blob/master/slides.md), and the full slides are at https://samfredlumley.github.io/git-workshop

The presentation was made using [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md#static-website).
